Hello everyone. This is my first real post on this test website. It doesn't look like much at the moment, but I hope to make it more and more impressive each day. I created for several purposes. The first was to help me learn more about the web development process, and to do so using a static site generator. The second was to create a place to store all of my projects and ideas. I also hope that this site may serve as a a resume holder or something else of that ilk in the future.

It has been a blast to create, and I hope you all stick with me as I continue to learn more about the process. Hopefully, I will learn inkscape and other useful programs by the time this is over, and I might even put a few images on this website soon. Thanks for sticking with me!
